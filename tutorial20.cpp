Procedure oriented programming 

> data openly move
> main focus on function
>Work on concept of class and object
> A class is a template to create of objects 
>treat data as a critical element

BAsic Concept in object Oriented Programming 

.Classes Basic template for creating object 
.object Basic run time entities 
.Data Abtraction& Encapsulation 

Inheritance _ Properties of one class can be inhereted into others 
Polymophism_ ability to take more then one forms Example of function overlaoding 
Dynamic Binding _ code which will execute is not known until the program  run
Message passing object message call formate

Benifits of OOPS 
software complext can be easy managed 
Principle of data hiding build secure systems
